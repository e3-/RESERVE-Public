    "# RESCUE\n",
    "**Renewable Energy Salient Combined Uncertainty Estimator**\n",
    "\n",
    "## *Description:*\n",
    "A machine-learning based framework to quantify the short-term uncertainty in netload forecast developed by E3. \n",
    "The main structure of the model include a multi-layer artificial neural net with the pinball loss function as objective. Conditional on combinations of input, the model is able to output quantile forecast for the net-load forecast error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the work stream of ingesting pre-processed data, set up cross validation folds, training and deployment, and calling functions for diagnostics. For detailed implementation of data preprocessing or quoted functions, please refer to other script files. This project is available in the [e3/RESCUE](https://github.com/e3-/RESCUE) Github online repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "RESCUE model supports multi-objective learning. For example, in addition to producing the quantile forecast of Net Load forecast error, it can be trained to simultaneously predict the Load, Solar and Wind forecast error. The objectives can be weighted per user's judgement of relative importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special note on CAISO use case: In other cases, the quantile forecast is trained on forecast errors, and represent the probablity distribution of forecast errors. For CAISO, as we are using RTPD forecast - RTD forecast as the response variable, it represents the distribution on forecast difference rather than forecast error. Nevertheless, the model structure and the logic still holds the same. \n",
    "## *Highlights:*\n",
    "1. Incorporating a wide gamut of information: weather, calendar, forecast, and lagged error aware. \n",
    "2. Intrinsically handles resource correlation as solar,wind, and load errors are co-trained within the model.\n",
    "3. Produces multiple prediction intervals for expected error in netload, load, solar and wind forecasting, for cherry picking down-stream\n",
    "4. Model agnostic. No requirement on knowledge of the inner workings of the netload forecast\n",
    "5. Adheres to best practice in statistics: cross validation, normalization, early-stopping, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## *To-dos:*\n",
    "1. Standardize the output for stability;\n",
    "3. Make actual reserves data part of dir_str if we foresee comparing model predictions to actual reserves in future work\n",

    "## 5.3.2 Monthly comparison of the coincident quantile between Predictions and Truth\n",
    "The goal of this section is to compare model prediction with historical error quantile. The goal is straightforward but the method is nothing but, since there is no direct way we can observe the historical error quantile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over a period of time tho, we can use the quantiles of all errors occured in this period to approximate the true quantile of the historical error. For a quantile, we picked the hour that the error falls on this quantile, and plot the coincident model prediction of the same quantile. The authors decided that the most interesting form of this plot, is to aggregate all errors of the same month and hour, and plot out the hourly coincident error and prediction. Reserves calculated from other methods can be overlaid on top for comparison with model predicted reserves. See explainition under **section 5.3** for sign convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to expect from a well trained model:**\n",
    "1. True forecast errors are generally comprised within the extent of model predictions\n",
    "2. Model's predictions doesn't fall well beyond true forecast errors all the time - which would be an indication that the model is being too conservative and thus wasteful of reserves. We're aiming to achieve target coverage while minimizing amount of reserves held to do so\n",
    "3. Median quantile of true forecast errors matches well with median quantile of model predictions of forecast errors\n",
